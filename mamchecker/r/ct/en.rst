Two quantities need a two-dimensional space to express all degrees of dependencies.
So `-` and `+` is not enough, but `\mathbb{C}` can handle it.

- In `\mathbb{R}`: `-3.2 a` means: (3.2, mal) `a` in counter direction of `a`

- In `\mathbb{C}`: `2e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}} a` means (2, mal) `a` in the direction
  `\frac{\pi}{3}` relative to `a`

Variables one normally deals with describe are extensive
(quantities, subsets, differences) and not points. 
3m means all points from 0 to 3m.

Two different sets, for which all combinations are possible 
can be called orthogonal. The angle between them is 90ยบ or `\frac{\pi}{2}`.
They generate the maximal set of combinations (area). 
The vector product is maximal, the dot product 0.

A two-dimensional vector `\vec{v}` and `z\in\mathbb{C}` are such extensive quantities
The created area is `\vec{v_1}\times\vec{v_2}` or `Re(z_1\bar{z_2})`.

Quantities that show to the same direction can be added.
Different directions can be added component-wise.
`\frac{\vec{v_1}\vec{v_2}}{|\vec{v_1}|}=\vec{v_1}_0\vec{v_2}` 
is the component of `\vec{v_2}`, that can be added to (in the direction of) `\vec{v_1}`.
`\frac{z_1\bar{z_2}}{|z_1|}` is the complex number with real part parallel to `z_1`
and imaginary part orthogonal to `z_1`. Normally you would simply do `z_1+z_2`,
i.e. calculate with the components given by the coordinate system.

The angle results from the ratio of generated area and maximal area
`\angle(\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2})=\arcsin\frac{|\vec{v_1}\times \vec{v_2}|}{|\vec{v_1}||\vec{v_2}|}` 
or from the ratio of the addable components to the whole length
`\angle(\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2})=\arccos\frac{\vec{v_1}\vec{v_2}}{|\vec{v_1}||\vec{v_2}|}` 
and with complex numbers
`\angle(z_1,z_2)=\arg(\frac{z_1\bar{z_2}}{|z_2||z_2|})=\arg{z_1\bar{z_2}}`.

Another word for angle is phase, that allows to overcome the meaning of direction by common use
Essential is the comparison of two quantities regarding the addable components.
To this end variables that do not represent a direction, but have influence on addability,
can be mapped to the angle range `[0,2\pi]`, which then is called phase.
Example: The time `t` of a vibration becomes `\varphi=\frac{2\pi}{T}t` or the combined 
time and space position of a wave becomes `\varphi=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}x+\frac{2\pi}{T}t`. 
`Ae^{i\varphi}` then represents the currently addable Amplitude.
