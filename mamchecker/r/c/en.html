and get a monthly interest rate of {{g.i}}%,
what will this saving accrue to in {{g.n}} months?<br> 
a) with interest compounded at the end of the month? (annuity)
%include('getorshow',idx = 0)
<br>
b) with interest compounded at the beginning of the month?  (annuity due)
%include('getorshow',idx = 1)
<br>
c) After how many months do the savings amount to {{g.m}} times the monthly annuity? 
%include('getorshow',idx = 2)
<br>
d) Which effective annual interest rate is equivalent (conformal) to the monthly {{g.i}}%? 
%include('getorshow',idx = 3, example='(1.0-100.0)')
