Correcting exercises can be automated. 

This way the teacher is faster to find
those students that have not yet memorized something 
or have not yet understood a concept or a relationship.

This can be done immediately after the presentation
in the same hour. This way

- The students have no time to copy from others.
- They also do not need to humilate themselves by disclosing that they have not yet understood.
- The students need to pay attention because they will have to know immediately afterwards.

The time spent by a teacher to correct exercise is 
better invested in a good preparation: 

- how to motivate the students and a topic,
- how to present the topic as easy as possible. 
- which questions to ask to practice and verify that the students have understood.

Mamcheckers provides a infrustructure 

- to quickly bring randomized exercise onto the web (via github)
- students answer questions via the browser on their smartphones
- the teacher can immediately afterwards see, who answered correctly or who has not yet answered.
