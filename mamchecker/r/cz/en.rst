Correcting exercises can be automated.

There are a lot of portals in the internet with content to explore and exercises for self check.
This falls into a similar category, but with its own approach.

The main purpose:

- Share exercise: everybody can to contribute exercises and content via github.
  Teachers, tutors, coaches, students, professors, autodidacts, ... well anybody
  can add exercises.

- Exercise numbers are randomly generated. This way an exercise can be reused.
  Students sitting next to each others will have different numbers and therefore
  cannot just copy the results.

- Provide exercises to everybody who learns and wants to test himself.

- Help coaches to check the exercise given to student.
  
The communication between coaches and students is a main design factor. 

Coaches can use Mamchecker remotely, but they can also use it in class.
In class students can use the browser on their smartphones to get and answer exercises.
The teachers can immediately see, who answered correctly or who has not yet answered.

This way the teacher is faster to find
those students that have not yet memorized something 
or have not yet understood a concept or a relationship.

Students can do exercises immediately after the presentation in class in the same hour. This way
the students

- have no time to copy from others
- do not need to humiliate themselves by disclosing that they have not understood
- do not need to overcome their shyness or uneasiness to hold up the whole class
- need to pay attention because they will have to know immediately afterwards

The teacher cannot look at the exercises at the same time, the software can.
To do it sequentially in class would holds up the students. 
If the teacher takes the exercises home
there is an unwanted delay.
The time spent by a teacher to correct exercise is 
better invested in a good preparation: 

- how to motivate the students and a topic,
- how to present the topic as easy as possible. 
- which questions to ask to practice and verify that the students have understood.

More parallelism in class is very important in order to make the time spent
there by the students worthwhile.
