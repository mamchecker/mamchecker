Mamchecker creates and checks exercises programmatically using python over the internet.

It is available at 

- http://www.mamchecker.eu
- `appspot <http://mamchecker.appspot.com>`_ 
  
These public sites currently are only for tests because limited by the free
`appengine quotas <https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas>`_.

It can be run locally, though, using 
`dev_appserver <https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver>`_, 
which is part of the 
`appengine SDK <https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads>`_.

.. code::

    #serves on port :8080
    dev_appserver.py mamchecker --host=0.0.0.0

Mamchecker uses `github <https://github.com/mamchecker/mamchecker>`_
to exchange exercises and content. Discussion related to development
can be done there. 

Further communication can be done via the
`Mamchecker Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mamchecker>`_.

``Mam`` comes from ``MAtheMathics``.
